### Features

- Feature 1
  When a user wants to create an account they must enter a username, password and email. The account is validated after a check to make sure an account connected to the same email does not exist.
- Feature 2
  Users are able to add items to their carts and check out. Adding an item and checking out reduces the item count so it does not appear still available to other users.
- Feature 3
  Clicking on any item brings the user to a larger view showing even more item information such as it's price, size, and name.
